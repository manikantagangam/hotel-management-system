# Hotel Management System

This is a Java-based hotel management system developed as an academic project for the second semester. It allows users to manage customer check-ins, check-outs, and room information. The system provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use and navigation.

## Features

- Customer Check-in: Enter customer details such as name, phone number, number of people, room type, and additional requisites.
- Room Information: Add new rooms to the hotel with room numbers, types, and the number of beds.
- Customer Check-out: Search and check-out customers based on their phone numbers.
- Customer Details: Display a table of all customer details including name, phone number, number of people, room type, extra requisites, and breakfast option.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) or any code editor

## How to Run

1. Download the project files.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE or code editor.
3. Compile and run the HotelManagement.java file.
4. The hotel management system GUI will open, allowing you to interact with the different functionalities.

## Usage

1. Check-in: Fill in the customer details, select the room type, and choose additional requisites and breakfast options. Click the "Check In" button to calculate and display the total cost.
2. Check-out: Navigate to the "Check out" tab, enter the customer's phone number, and click the "Check-out" button. The system will search for the customer's details and display them in a table. If the customer is found, they will be checked out and removed from the customer details table.
